                            NOTE: Basic/built-in text editors are Notepad (Windows) and TextEdit (Macs). Basic text editors are entirely sufficient for when you’re just getting started.

                            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to design the webpage to make it attractive.<br> 
                             The reason of using CSS is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. <br>
                             CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.
                             There are three types of CSS which are given below:<br>

                                Inline CSS
                                <br>

Base for web development: HTML and CSS is the basic skill that every web developer should know. It is the basic skill that is required for building a website.<br>
Makes your website look attractive: A website that’s dull and plain will not attract the user most probably, so adding some style would surely make your website presentable to the user.<br>
Makes the design come live: A web developer is responsible in making the design given to him as a live product. CSS is used for styling to develop the design of the website.<br>
Increases user experience of website: A website with a simple yet beautiful UI would help the users to go through the website easily. CSS is used to make the user interface better.<br>

                        <p class="accordion__description">
                            Advantages of using CSS:

                           1. CSS helps you save time: CSS can be written once and then reused in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to an unlimited number of Web pages.<br>
                           2. Results in less code: We use less code because we define the property with a value in a common style class and use the same class in multiple places. Less code means less bandwidth consumption and easier content maintenance.<br>
                           3. Easy maintenance: Because we define styles globally or in a common location, any changes are simple. For example, on a website, all of the product names are displayed using a specific style property. We can now change the style throughout the site by changing the style class at the external style sheet for the product name. We can keep multiple style sheets and use them based on the situation. The use of property inheritance methods made it simple to maintain multiple styles of the same tag.<br>
                           4. Web standards around the world: HTML attributes are now deprecated, and CSS is recommended instead. As a result, it’s a good idea to start using CSS in all HTML pages to ensure compatibility with future browsers.<br>
                           5. Pages are downloaded quickly: Because browsers cached the style sheet page, page loading became faster. When different pages of the same site use the same CSS, the styles classes are not loaded from the server.<br>

                            JavaScript is a widely-used programming language. Given below are some domains/products that can be built using JavaScript:<br>

1. Websites: JavaScript helps us to add behavior of our website. It helps users to interact with the website. For eg. clicking on buttons, saving details, uploading details on the website, etc.<br>
2. Web Servers: We can make robust server applications using JavaScript. To be precise we use JavaScript frameworks like Node.js and Express.js to build these servers.<br>
3. Game Development: In Game Development industry, JavaScript is used widely. With the addition of HTML5 Canvas, it’s now possible to make 2D and 3D games in JavaScript very efficiently.<br>
4. 3D Drawings: JavaScript in addition with HTML Canvas is used to make three-dimensional graphics.<br>
5. Mobile Apps: Mobile applications are the most popular modes of communicating these days. JavaScript also used to design mobile applications. There are many JavaScript frameworks using which we can make android, IOS, and hybrid apps.<br>
6. Smartwatch Apps: The popular smartwatch maker Pebble has created Pebble.js, a small JavaScript framework that allows a developer to create an application for the Pebble line of watches in JavaScript.<br>

                            2. Used both Client and Server-side: Earlier JavaScript was used to build client-side applications only, but with the evolution of its frameworks namely Node.js and Express.js, it is now widely used for building server-side applications too.<br>
                            3. Helps to build a complete solution: As we saw, JavaScript is widely used in both client and server-side applications, therefore it helps us to build an end-to-end solution to a given problem.<br>
                            4. Used everywhere: JavaScript is so loved because it can be used anywhere. It can be used to develop websites, games or mobile apps, etc.<br>
                            5. Huge community support: JavaScript has a huge community of users and mentors who love this language and take it’s legacy forward.<br>
